Those are my files from my cypress studies at Alura. The web application was provided by the instructor and all I did was run some e2e tests using cypress.

Therefore you should probably find other repositories with code almost identical to this one.
This is my repository, there are many like it but this one is my own.

Node version used: 20.10.0
